# Your Tour


## Find landmarks near your vacation destination and then populate the most efficient route to travel from one destination to the next 


The purpose of this application is to help users plan their visit to a new city by identifying and selecting landmarks of interest. Whether for a day trip or a weekend getaway, users can compile a list of preferred landmarks. Once selected, the app generates an itinerary and allows users to view the most efficient travel route to visit all chosen landmarks with a click of the "Generate Route" button. Detailed information such as location name, address, description, schedule, and photos of each landmark are provided, along with options to rate them based on personal experience. Google Maps integration ensures ease of navigation throughout the trip.


NOTE: This final capstone project involved gathering specific information for a city, Montreal in this case, and curating a list of pre-populated landmarks for that city as requested by the Product Owner.
